# linux-dotfiles
A repository to sync and back up my linux config files (or "dotfiles")



## System
My main machine is a desktop pc running Manjaro i3. I've stripped most of the default packages and features and modified system files and scripts. There is a high chance that my dotfiles wont work out of the box so you'll have to figure out yourself. That being said, feel free to ask me about them.

## Programs I use

* Window Manager: bspwm
* Keybindings: sxhkd
* Terminal: URxvt
* Fetch: pfetch
* File Manager: lf
* Editor: neovim, vscode
* Font: Noto Sans (Interface) DejaVu (Terminal)
* Color theme: look into ~/.Xresources and ~/.config/xrdb
* Shell: zsh (theme: my own rainbowie)
* Bar: Polybar
* Notification daemon: Dunst
* Program Launcher: dmenu (~/.local/bin/dmenu_launcher). https://github.com/druskus20/dmenu-build
* Lock Screen: blurlock
* Transparency: picom
